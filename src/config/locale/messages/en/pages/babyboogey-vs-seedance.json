            "question": "Is BabyBoogey really better than Seedance for baby dance videos?",
            "answer": "For baby-specific dance videos, yes. BabyBoogey was purpose-built for this use case with 50+ baby dance templates, optimized face animation for infants and toddlers, and a one-click workflow. Seedance 2.0 is a more powerful general-purpose video model, but it requires prompt engineering and has no baby-specific features. If your goal is adorable baby dance clips, BabyBoogey is the better choice."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can Seedance 2.0 make baby dance videos?",
            "answer": "Technically, yes. Seedance 2.0 can generate video of virtually any subject, including babies dancing. However, you will need to write detailed prompts, experiment with settings, and accept that results may be inconsistent. There are no baby dance templates or child-safe defaults. BabyBoogey gives you the same end result with a fraction of the effort."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is BabyBoogey a good Seedance alternative?",
            "answer": "If you are specifically looking to create baby dance videos, BabyBoogey is the best Seedance alternative available. It is easier to use, more affordable for casual creators, and produces baby dance videos that look more natural and adorable out of the box. For other types of AI video generation, Seedance remains a strong general-purpose option."
          },
          {
            "question": "Which is cheaper — BabyBoogey or Seedance?",
            "answer": "BabyBoogey is significantly more affordable for baby dance video creation. It offers a free tier with no credit card required, and paid plans start at $4.99. Seedance 2.0 uses API-based pricing that can get expensive quickly, especially for casual users who only want a few fun videos. For families and hobbyists, BabyBoogey offers much better value."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do I need to write prompts with BabyBoogey?",
            "answer": "No. Unlike Seedance 2.0, BabyBoogey does not require any text prompts. You simply upload a baby photo, choose from one of 50+ dance templates, and the AI handles everything else. This makes it perfect for parents, grandparents, and anyone who wants quick results without learning how to write AI prompts."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is my baby's photo safe with BabyBoogey?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. BabyBoogey was built with child safety as a top priority. All photos are encrypted, stored in your private account, and can be auto-deleted after processing. Your baby's photos are never used for AI model training. This level of child-specific privacy protection is not available in general-purpose platforms like Seedance."
          },
          {
            "question": "How fast is BabyBoogey compared to Seedance?",
            "answer": "BabyBoogey generates most baby dance videos in about 30 seconds. Seedance 2.0 generation times vary from one to several minutes depending on resolution, video length, and current server load. For quick, shareable baby dance clips, BabyBoogey's speed is hard to beat."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I use BabyBoogey for non-baby photos?",
            "answer": "Yes! While BabyBoogey is optimized for baby and toddler photos, its AI face animator works well with any clear face photo, including adults, kids, and even pets. That said, the dance templates are designed with baby proportions in mind, so you will get the best results with little ones."
