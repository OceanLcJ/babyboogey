If your AI baby dance video looks a little “off”, it’s usually not because anything is broken—it’s because the input photo (and motion style) needs a better match. Here are the quickest fixes that improve results immediately.

If you haven’t generated one yet, start with the step-by-step guide: [/blog/how-to-make-a-baby-dance-video](/blog/how-to-make-a-baby-dance-video).

## 1) Use a sharper photo than you think you need

AI motion is very sensitive to blur around facial features. Prefer the original camera photo over screenshots.

## 2) Avoid heavy shadows on the face

Side lighting can create strong contrast that turns into flicker during motion. Softer, even lighting usually produces the cleanest result.

## 3) Keep the background simple

Busy backgrounds (patterns, crowds, text) tend to “swim” or smear during movement. A plain wall or bed is a great default.

## 4) Pick a motion style that matches the crop

- **Close-up face**: choose low-motion / gentle styles
- **Upper body visible**: most styles work well
- **Full body**: energetic styles look best

## 5) Try two photos for the same style

When you’re not sure what’s wrong, compare two photos with the same style. Usually one input will clearly look better—and you’ll learn what to look for.

## 6) Don’t overdo accessories

Hats, pacifiers, hands in front of the mouth, or big toys can confuse facial motion. If you have an option, use a simpler photo.

## 7) Share more safely

Before posting publicly:

- Remove location cues (school badges, street signs, etc.)
- Avoid photos with other children in frame
- Review: [/privacy-policy](/privacy-policy) and [/terms-of-service](/terms-of-service)

## Quick checklist

- Clear face, minimal blur
- Even lighting
- Simple background
- Motion style matches crop
