Turning a single baby photo into a cute dancing video is one of those “how is this possible?” moments. This guide walks you through a simple workflow, plus the small details that make your result look much more natural.

## What you’ll need

- One clear baby photo (front-facing works best)
- A few minutes
- A device with a stable internet connection

## Step 1: Pick the right photo

The input photo matters more than most people expect.

**Best results**
- Face is clear (not blocked by hands, toys, or hats)
- Good lighting (avoid heavy shadows)
- Minimal blur (especially around eyes and mouth)
- Background isn’t too busy

**Avoid**
- Extreme angles (top-down or profile shots)
- Low-resolution screenshots
- Heavy beauty filters

## Step 2: Upload your photo

Go to BabyBoogey and upload your photo. If you’re new, check the examples first to see what styles look like: [/showcases](/showcases).

## Step 3: Choose a dance style (and optional music)

Different dances fit different photos.

- **Cute / playful**: works great for smiling photos
- **Energetic**: better with full-body photos (if available)
- **Minimal motion**: a safer choice for close-up portraits

If you can add music, keep it simple—busy tracks can make the motion feel chaotic.

## Step 4: Generate, preview, and iterate

Generate the video, preview it, then iterate:

- If the face looks “off”, try a clearer photo or choose a less aggressive motion style.
- If the background distracts, pick a cleaner photo next time.
- If the output is too fast, choose a calmer dance or shorter sequence (when available).

## Troubleshooting common issues

### The face warps or flickers
**Fix**: Use a higher-quality photo, avoid heavy shadows, and try a lower-motion style.

### The body looks unnatural
**Fix**: Prefer photos where shoulders and torso are visible; avoid extreme close-ups.

### The background gets messy
**Fix**: Use a photo with a clean background (plain wall, bed, etc.).

## Safer sharing & privacy tips

- Don’t upload photos with sensitive personal info in the frame (IDs, addresses).
- If you plan to post publicly, consider using a photo that doesn’t reveal location cues.
- Review our policies before sharing: [/privacy-policy](/privacy-policy) and [/terms-of-service](/terms-of-service).

## Next steps

- Compare 2–3 different photos for the same dance style
- Try a different style for the same photo
- Share your favorite result and tag us (if you’d like)
