title: Image-to-Video Prompting Notes
---

This note summarizes common prompt patterns across image-to-video tools and how we apply them in this repo’s “Photo to Dance” flow.

## Market patterns (high-level)

- The **input image defines the subject + composition**; the prompt should focus on **motion, action, and camera**.
- “Image-to-video” prompts generally work better when you **describe what changes over time**, not what already exists in the image.
- Many tools support **negative prompts** to reduce artifacts like warping, flicker, extra limbs, or text overlays.

## Veo (via Replicate) parameters worth supporting

- `prompt`
- `image` (image-to-video, first frame) or `reference_images` (reference-to-video)
- `negative_prompt`
- `duration` (seconds)
- `aspect_ratio`
- `resolution`

## Recommended prompt structure (Photo to Dance)

Keep it short and motion-first:

- **Action:** “The child starts dancing…”
- **Dance style:** “hip-hop / cute wiggle / viral dance…”
- **Constraints:** “keep identity and clothing consistent; stable background; smooth motion”
- **Camera:** “locked-off medium shot” (or slow push-in if desired)
